# EPL Prediction using TensorFlow

The English Premier League (EPL) is the top-tier football competition in England, widely considered the most-watched and followed league globally. It also boasts the highest financial turnover of any football league, attracting fans and spectators worldwide.

The league features famous teams like Arsenal FC, Chelsea FC, Liverpool FC, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur, each with a massive fan base.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the EPL team rankings using machine learning models such as:

- **Random Forest**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **TensorFlow-based models**

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical EPL data, including match statistics, team performance, and player stats.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for modeling.
3. **Modeling**: Building and training models using Random Forest, MLP, and TensorFlow to predict future EPL rankings.
4. **Prediction**: Using the trained models to make predictions and analyze performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Discussing the most important insights from the model's results and their implications for future predictions.
